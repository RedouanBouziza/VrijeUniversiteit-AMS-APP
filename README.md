About:
The VU University Ambulatory Monitoring System (VU-AMS) was developed by the department of Biological Psychology and the Technical Department (ITM) of the Faculty of Psychology and Education to allow recording of autonomic and cardiovascular activity in a variety of research settings, including ambulatory monitoring in naturalistic settings. The dedicated support of the ITM of the Faculty of Psychology and Education guarantees high technical standards for the VU-AMS device and its supporting software program.

The Project:
Its an app that works with the new wearable device. The app is written in jetpack compose. The function of the app is to see a chart that shows a line with data, the data that will be shown is from the device. The data is all things from the hearth and orientation of the device. In the app you need to see if you’re connected to the device and some device information like, the battery percentage. An easy way to see is on the home screen because if the device is receiving data and is connected with the app, than the home screen will show 2 charts with data.
